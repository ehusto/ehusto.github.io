      <h2>Education Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        Studying mechanical engineering challenged me to master complex concepts
        and develop strong problem-solving skills. Hands-on labs and design
        projects transformed theory into practice, making every obstacle
        engaging and rewarding. Later, pursuing Technology Entrepreneurship and
        Management expanded my perspective, balancing technical knowledge with
        business strategy, and inspiring creative approaches to engineering and
        software solutions.

      <h2>Professional Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve faced challenges ranging from improving
        manufacturing processes to implementing software tools that enhance
        efficiency. Each project demanded critical thinking, adaptability, and
        collaboration. The most rewarding moments came from solving complex
        problems that combine design, fabrication, and technology to produce
        tangible, real-world results.

      <h2>Skills & Expertise</h2>
      <p>
        These experiences cultivated expertise in software development for
        manufacturing, engineering design, fabrication processes, and quality
        management. I thrive in environments that demand precision, innovation,
        and practical solutions.
